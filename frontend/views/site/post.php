                While everyone overthinks situations once in a while, some people are plagued with a constant barrage of thoughts all the time. Chronic overthinkers rehash conversations they had yesterday, second-guess every decision they make, and imagine disastrous outcomes all day every day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">
                Thinking too much about something often involves more than words — overthinkers conjure up disastrous images too. Their minds resemble a movie where they imagine their car going off the road or they replay distressing events over and over again.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">
                Thinking too much prevents them from getting anything done. And it wreaks havoc on their mood.

            <h4 class="post__h4">Desctructive thought patterns</h4>
            <p class="post__p">
                Overthinking often involves two destructive thought patterns — ruminating and incessant worrying.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">Ruminating involves dwelling on the past. Thoughts may include things like:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p_italic">
                • I shouldn’t have said those things at the meeting yesterday. Everyone must think I’m an idiot.
            </p>

            <h4 class="post__h4">1. Notice when you’re stuck in your head.</h4>
            <p class="post__p">
                Overthinking can become such a habit that you don’t even recognize when you’re doing it. Start paying attention to the way you think so you can become aware of the problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">When you’re replaying events in your mind over and over, or worrying about things you can’t control, acknowledge that your thoughts aren’t productive. Thinking is only helpful when it leads to positive action.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="post__h4">2. Keep the focus on problem-solving.</h4>
            <p class="post__p">Dwelling on your problems isn’t helpful — but looking for solutions is. If it’s something you have some control over, consider how you can prevent the problem or challenge yourself to identify five potential solutions.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">If it’s something you have no control over — like a natural disaster — think about the strategies you can use to cope with it. Focus on the things you can control, like your attitude and effort.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="post__h4">3. Challenge your thoughts.</h4>
            <p class="post__p">It’s easy to get carried away with negative thoughts. So before you conclude that calling in sick is going to get you fired, or that forgetting one deadline will cause you to become homeless, acknowledge that your thoughts may be exaggeratedly negative.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="post__p">
                Remember that your emotions will interfere with your ability to look at situations objectively. Take a step back and look at the evidence. What evidence do you have that your thought is true? What evidence do you have that your thought isn’t true?
